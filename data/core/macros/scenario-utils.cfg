#define FOREVER
    # Max number of turns in a scenario, mainly for use as a turn upper bound
    # in ai declarations for aggression, etc.

#define INFINITY
    # The effectively infinite radius.
999 #enddef

#define EVERYWHERE
    # Everywhere on the map.  For filters that would otherwise touch recall lists.
x,y=1-infinity,1-infinity #enddef

#define NO_MAP_DATA
    # The display code in the game becomes confused if you give it a
    # scenario with no map data (like, a text epilogue).  Use this
    # macro to feed it dummy map data that won't actually be used.

#define AI_CANT_PLAY SIDES
    # Displays a standard warning at the start of the first AI turn for each
    # given side about the AI not knowing how to play this side properly. Use
    # this to tag sides intended solely for human players in special multiplayer
    # scenarios (ones with shops, custom right-click options and such).

    # Example:
    # ! {AI_CANT_PLAY 1,2,3,4}
