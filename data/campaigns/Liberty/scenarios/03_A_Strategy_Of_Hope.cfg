Been a strange few days. Had to leave Dallben real quick. We grabbed as much stuff as we could in just a day, some food, some clothes, sis’s lucky bracelet... and made off for Delwyn as quick as these old bones let me. Be a three day journey there for me, but I sended Harper ahead for Relana first. Said we’d meets her in the usual hiding spot in the swamp."

Don’t matter whoever’s the one giving out them orders, those stinkers in Weldyn always be making trouble for us countryfolk."

I don’t be keen on fighting no war with Wesnoth. But... I guess, I don’t really got no choice either. Harper’s still too younger to be leading anyone, and don’t seem like anyone else in the village be wanting the responsibility."

What woulds she say to me now? Probably something like, “Quit yapping ya old dog and focus on what you’re doing. We’ve got to be getting them people to safety.” Cheeky kid, that one. But, she’d be right, I has me a responsibility to our people. Got a lot of trouble ahead of us..."
