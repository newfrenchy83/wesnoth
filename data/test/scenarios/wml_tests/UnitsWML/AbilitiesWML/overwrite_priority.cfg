#####
# API(s) being tested: [overwrite]priority=,[overwrite][filter_specials]
##
# Actions:
# Give Bob an ability minimal_damage, which reduces his weapon damage to 1.
# Give Bob an ability double_damage, which multiplies the damage by 2 and also overwrites minimal_damage.
# Check that Bob's weapon does the expected amount of damage.
# Give Bob an ability seven_times_damage, which multiplies the damage by 7 and with a high priority would overwrite another ability which isn't part of this test.
# Check that Bob's weapon does the expected amount of damage.
##
# Expected end state:
# TODO: expectation is currently under discussion
